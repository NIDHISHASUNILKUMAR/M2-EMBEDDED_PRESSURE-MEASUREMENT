# Introduction:

In hospital operating theatres, semiconductor manufacturing facilities, computer data centers and biochemical research laboratories, it is necessary toÂ ensure either a slightly higher or lower air pressure to prevent a contaminated atmosphere leaking outside or a clean atmosphere becoming contaminated from outside air.So inorder to have an idea over our surrounding pressure'pressure measurement' is important.

# Features:

* Detects the room pressure and displays value of pressure on the display.
* Simple circuit design and easy to. Understand.
* Obtaining accurate and meaningful data is important in determining the quality and consistency of the product. For these reasons, accurate sensors are absolutely critical in obtaining this information.

# 4W'S and 1H:

## What:

It gives an awareness over the pressure in which we are residing .

## Why:

 Pressure measuring instruments are used to measure the pressure of liquids or gases to maintain the quality standards of the products, for safety concerns of the units, to avoid explosions, to maintain the efficient working of machinery as well as controlling pressure is important for the longevity of the machinery.
 
 ## Where:
 
 *Used in automotive industry, engine control, weather stations etc.
 
 *Hospital operating theatres, semiconductor manufacturing facilities, computer data centers and biochemical research laboratories. 
 
 ## Who:
 
It does not require the manual involvement to detect. So anyone who needs can use this.
 
 ## How:
 
  A sensor which is the main part of this project and it is the one which detects and displays the value.
  
 # Swot Analysis:

 ## Strength: 
 
 It's strength is compact in size and accuracy in displaying the correct pressure.

## Weakness:

Since we are using tiny electronic component we have to be careful.

## Opportunity:

We should create an opportunity to make our product used by everyone by providing an awareness over the adverse effects of over the pressure and importance of surveiling the pressure.

## Threat:

Most of the people know about this features but we need to prove the importance of this device in each and every embedded projects to get aware.

The internal block diagram of MPX4115A pressure sensor is shown below. It has three pins +5 volt input pin, ground pin and output pin and we measure the output voltage from this pin and convert it back in pressure using the formula.
